# Digital hype test challenge (Node.js + Jest) 💻

This is a repo where I present my solutions for the test challenge given from the Digitalhype company to be able to aspire to the position of fullstack developer

## Project setup 📝

After you clone the repo you need to install the corresponding packages of the `package.json` file

```bash
# npm
npm install
```

## How to run the challenges

You can run the test suites that I prepared with Jest, that basically puts the examples of the PDF plus some other that I created. To run the tests suites execute the following command

```bash
npm run test
```

# How to run the terminal app! 📺

In this branch I created a terminal application to test the function, here you have a simple menu built using the
[inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) and the [colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) packages.

To try it out you only need to run the following command and the application will pop up

```bash
npm run app
```

Once open up you can try the function or exit the app. For testing the function you'll be asked to provide the **rootPath** and the **maxDepth**, and then the application will show you the output of the function

**NOTE**: You can see a more detailed tree on the `results/tree.json` file on the root of the project

### Happy review! 🚀
