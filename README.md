This is a repo where I present my solutions for the test challenge given from the Digitalhype company to be able to aspire to the position of fullstack developer

## Project setup 📝

After you clone the repo you need to install the corresponding packages of the `package.json` file

npm install
```

## How to run the challenges

You can run the test suites that I prepared with Jest, that basically puts the examples of the PDF plus some other that I created. To run the tests suites execute the following command
